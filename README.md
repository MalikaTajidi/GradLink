# GradLink  

GradLink is a networking and mentorship platform designed to foster connections between current students and alumni, offering valuable career insights, mentorship opportunities, and professional guidance.  

# About This Repository  

This repository contains all the backend work I contributed to during the development of the GradLink platform. It includes essential features and services for managing users , WebSocket-based communication, and connecting students with alumni for mentorship and career guidance. 
I also implemented Docker to containerize the backend, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments, making the project scalable and efficient.




**GradLink** aims to empower students in their professional journey by leveraging the experiences and insights of alumni from their school.
